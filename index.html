            <p>Now I am practicing day and night on how to become a professional web developer. My goal right now is to be a web developer. I never thought ‘I can achieve my goal if I practice 4 months or 6 months or one year’. If I practice every day and night, one day my goal will meet me. I look forward to that day. I wish that day come to be soon when I am to be a professional web developer. I will not stop until I become a Web Developer.</p>

            <p>Now I am just a beginner level web developer. I know everything that I need to create a simple website. I know about Basic HTML CSS to create a website. I also know how to create a 'website link'. I am creating a basic website, which one you are sawing at now. If you ever need a basic website, you can remind me.</p>
